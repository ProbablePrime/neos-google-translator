# Neos Google Translator

Files and configuration for my version of a Neos Google Translator.

Based off of the initial work by VEX and other members of the JP Neos Community, I re-shuffled the in-game panel and the out of game script around to make things a lot easier to use. I present both the setup and the scripts here for easy access and for version tracking.
